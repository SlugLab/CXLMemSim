# Topology-Aware Hotness Prediction and Strategy Optimization

This enhanced memory tiering implementation goes beyond simple performance heat maps to provide intelligent topology selection and strategy optimization based on comprehensive hotness prediction.

## 🎯 Key Innovation

Instead of just visualizing performance across different configurations, this system:
1. **Predicts hotness patterns** based on workload characteristics
2. **Evaluates multiple CXL topologies** to find the optimal structure
3. **Selects the best memory management strategy** for each workload-topology combination
4. **Provides actionable recommendations** with confidence scores and reasoning

## 🚀 Features

### 1. Advanced Hotness Prediction
- **ML-based prediction** using gradient boosting models
- **Multi-dimensional analysis** considering:
  - Memory intensity and access locality
  - Temporal and spatial reuse patterns
  - Thread count and access pattern types
- **Per-endpoint hotness tracking** for fine-grained optimization

### 2. Topology-Aware Optimization
- **Built-in topology library** with common CXL configurations:
  - Flat topologies (all endpoints at same level)
  - Hierarchical topologies (multi-level switches)
  - Star topologies (centralized switching)
  - Mesh topologies (complex interconnections)
- **Automatic topology evaluation** based on:
  - Latency characteristics
  - Bandwidth distribution
  - Hop distance penalties

### 3. Intelligent Strategy Selection
- **Multiple memory management strategies**:
  - Static policies (balanced, local-heavy, CXL-heavy)
  - Dynamic hotness-based policies
  - Topology-optimized policies
  - Adaptive learning policies
  - ML-based predictive policies
  - Hybrid adaptive policies
- **Strategy matching** based on:
  - Workload type and characteristics
  - Hotness skew and distribution
  - Performance requirements
  - Topology structure

### 4. Comprehensive Recommendations
- **Best configuration selection** with reasoning
- **Confidence scores** for recommendations
- **Performance predictions** for each configuration
- **Detailed analysis reports** with visualizations
